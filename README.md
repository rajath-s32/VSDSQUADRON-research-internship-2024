## 3. confirming using spike and after debugging
![SPIKE](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42880870-91cd-42cf-9252-94cb4b963d6d)


# B. write a simple C program for any simple application and RISC-V GCC/SPIKE

# STEPS
## 1. i selected the code for a half adder
A half adder is a basic digital circuit that adds two single binary digits and produces a sum and a carry. The logic behind a half adder can be expressed with the following equations:

Sum: 
S=A⊕B (A XOR B)
Carry: 
C=A⋅B (A AND B)


## 2. writing the code in C Program
